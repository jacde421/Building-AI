# **AI-driven Smart Traffic Management System**  
*Final project for the Building AI course*

## Summary
This project aims to use AI to optimize traffic flow in cities by analyzing real-time data from cameras and sensors. Using machine learning, the system can predict traffic congestion and adjust traffic lights dynamically to reduce waiting times and emissions.

## **Background**
### Problem statement:
-  Traffic congestion is a major issue in many cities, leading to lost time and increased pollution.
-  Traffic lights often follow fixed schedules rather than responding to real-time traffic changes.
-  A more intelligent system could reduce travel time and improve urban mobility.

### My motivation:
-  I am interested in smart cities and want to contribute to reducing traffic problems using AI.
-  A more efficient traffic system can lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

## **How is it used?**
-  Traffic data is collected via cameras and IoT sensors placed at intersections.
-  AI analyzes traffic patterns and predicts congestion.
-  The system dynamically adjusts traffic lights to optimize flow.
-  The target users are municipalities and urban planners looking to improve traffic efficiency.

## **Data sources and AI methods**
###  **Data sources:**
-  Data is sourced from open city databases and real-time traffic cameras.
-  Google Traffic API and governmental road sensors are used to gather information on vehicle density.

###  **AI methods:**
- **Machine learning** is used to train the model to identify traffic patterns.
- **Neural networks and reinforcement learning** are applied to optimize real-time traffic light control.

## **Challenges**
-  **Limitations:** Requires real-time data, which may be difficult to access.
-  **Ethical considerations:** Camera-based traffic monitoring raises privacy concerns.
-  **Technical challenges:** Needs high computational power and stable internet connectivity.

## **What next?**
-  Potential integration with autonomous vehicles.
-  Implementation in more cities and development of more advanced prediction models.
-  Further research on AI's impact on traffic safety and efficiency.
